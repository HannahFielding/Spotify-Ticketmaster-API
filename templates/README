Spotify Concert Recommender
Author : Hannah Fielding
Overview

This web application integrates the Spotify and Ticketmaster APIs to recommend live concerts
based on a user's listening preferences. After authenticating with Spotify, the application
analyzes the user's playlists and saved tracks to identify their most frequently listened-to
artists, then retrieves upcoming U.S. concert events from Ticketmaster.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate backend API integration, OAuth authentication,
data aggregation, and real-time third-party service interaction.
